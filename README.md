**brief explanation**

> the individual enhancement of my other 'azulGame' repository, brief explanation of the assignment is located there.

> Students were given multiple choices for enhancements to complete, all awarding different marks. I completed all small enhancements, then the optional major enhancement, an AI player to go against in the game.

> I started by fully re-structuring the program, and implementing the much needed changes / fixes. Then adding the AI mode onto the game.
